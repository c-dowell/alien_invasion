"# alien_invasion"

In Alien Invasion, a player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom centre of the screen. 
The player can move the ship from side to side and fire bullets from the ship using input commands.
The objective is to shoot down aliens which will appear in a fleet from the top of the screen, moving down and across. If the player shoots down them all, a new fleet will appear which moves faster than the last
Each type of alien will reward a different number of points, which will be tallied up and added to your score whenever an alien is vaporised!
If any alien hits the player's ship or touches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship.
If a player loses three ships, the game ends and your final score will be presented
